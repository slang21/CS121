Priority Ordered List of Product Requirements:

Be able to assess transactions -
Priority: (High) 
The product must be able to assess transactions to be able to function properly. Barebone requirement that is necessary for the product to function properly.
Confidence: (High)
We understand that this is a vital requirement to have since without it, the product would not be able to optimize payments. This requirement is from our initial proposal and was reinforced by the elicitation.
Difficulty: (Medium) 
At first glance, it seems that it should be a simple function that is able to process transactions such as receiving bill information and processing a payment. However, we feel that the difficulty in having the ability to make transactions may come from how the process of paying with an app works as well as how merchants accept payments.
Card Optimization - 
Priority: (High)
Our product’s main feature is advertised as optimization. The product should thus be able to produce desired results from the user
Confidence: (Medium)
There are several ways of optimizing the choice of cards a user can use. Some ways mentioned during the elicitation are based on rewards, credit improvement, lowering debt tactically, and based on interest rates.This requirement is from our initial proposal and was reinforced by the elicitation.
Difficulty: (High) 
Our choices of how and what we are optimizing will decide how difficult the optimization process is. We will also have to figure out strategies to ensure the correctness of the algorithm over time.

Balance Payoff Optimization
Priority: (High) 
Payoff credit card balance is a very important step after you make transactions after each billing cycle. Users would like to know how they should pay off their bills smartly given interest rate and budget. 
Confidence: (High)
It’s a pretty straightforward process to help people to save their money.  This requirement was not in our initial proposal and was introduced as a good idea during the elicitation. This idea is a great plus in addition to daily spending optimization.
Difficulty: (Low) 
We just need to consider the APR and budget to come up with a finance plan. It’s relatively easier than card optimization.

Make Payments with a card - digital or physical
Priority (Medium)
This would be an amazing feature and would make our product truly unique and simple to use
Confidence (Low)
This is going to be the most difficult problem with this idea, and it seems like a largely bureaucratic issue because there are so many actors in payment processing and payment networks. This requirement is part of our initial proposal.
Difficulty (High)
There is a lot that we don’t really understand about payment networks and the work involved in distributing cards that could stand in for other cards. 

Help Improving Credit -
Priority: (Medium)
It only applies to people with low income and low credit scores. It’s great to have it, but we have some other universal features as prioritized requirements.
Confidence: (High)
Credit score model is known, so we just need to look into current models and identify important factors. We will be able to analyze users' financial data and credit score models to give suggestions. This requirement is from our initial proposal and was reinforced by the elicitation.
Difficulty: (Easy)
Given its clear goal and existing credit models, we believe it will be not too hard to find the algorithm of credit improvement.

 Privacy Features-
Priority: (Medium) 
Since our product involves credit cards, it would be crucial to make sure our product does not harm the user. Although, the interviewees had slight disregard or complacent attitude for their privacy and security of using apps that manage their finances, it is still a general priority to make sure the privacy and information of the user is safe and secure. 
Confidence: (Medium)
In general, each aspect of our system should be providing different methods of protecting the user. For example, by using our application to pay, the user would be able to avoid any physical card reader; a physical proxy card would allow the user to also avoid using their own personal cards, etc. In particular, we hope to add a particular privacy feature to prevent fraud. One idea in particular that we presented was utilizing a preselected amount of money that the user chooses when deciding to make payments. This would mean that if the security of the transaction was bypassed, only a limited amount of money would be taken. This idea could further develop into more fraud detecting applications. This requirement is from our initial proposal and was reinforced by the elicitation.
Difficulty: (High) 
In particular for the application of creating a privacy feature that could minimize the risk of fraud for the user, the idea of creating an ideal application that could protect against credit card fraud could be classified as beyond the scope of this class. There are several security companies that are focused on this particular topic and have far more experience and expertise on the subject. Likewise, numerous people all around the world have been developing methods towards stealing credit card information from people. As such, we plan on just creating a form of security throughout the app through numerous applications and with a couple of specific privacy features. We make sure that we will leave the rest of the classified information to the professionals.

Customizing Optimization - 
Priority: (Medium)  
Many of the interviewees mentioned that it would be great to have a choice in the selection process of the optimization for what card they would have to make payments with. Since it is very favorable among the interviewees, we consider this as a higher medium on the list as it would be inline with the regular optimization while being a feature for users. It’s very important for our App to satisfy users with different priorities and needs.
Confidence: (High)
We understand that the idea for customizing the optimal card from our algorithm will allow adding custom values of choice for users. This requirement was not in our initial proposal and was introduced as a good idea during the elicitation. The idea is that users should be allowed to rank different factors (i.e. interest, reward, credit score) and our optimization algorithm could perform accordingly.
Difficulty: (Easy) 
The difficulty of implementation would rely on how well we create an algorithm for the regular optimization. Overall, the customization option would be modifications of the algorithm. Our algorithm should have the capacity to allow for customization such as weights for rewards, etc., so that the optimal card being outputted would still match the user's preferences while minimizing any 

Physical Card Option -
Priority: (Medium)
Mobile/Virtual card payment is not acceptable everywhere. Also, phones could be running out of battery and people may lose their phones. It’s very important to support a physical card feature. However, it has a lower priority because it could be an offline extension to our App and need more external collaboration.
Confidence: (Low)
It will be really hard to implement in a short time frame given its large workload. Physical card support is not a pure software development task. However, we will keep in mind when structuring and maybe implement this feature later on. This requirement is from our initial proposal and was reinforced by the elicitation.
Difficulty: (Hard) 
We cannot implement physical card support on our own. It needs external support from some proxy card distributor, which makes this requirement hard.

Given person’s financial situation -
Priority: (Low) 
Compared to the essential requirements that provide functional use, this is a non-functional requirement. Although it would be great to add, this requirement has aesthetic, user-facing qualities that could be implemented later on.
Confidence: (High)
Presenting a person’s financial situation would consist of tracking a person’s budget/spending/debt/etc. One application of this is the idea of visually presenting the information to the user using graphs and tables. This would be a visual feature that would improve the user experience. This idea came from our initial proposal and mentioned briefly during the elicitation. 
Difficulty: (Easy)  
The implementation would rely on what sorts of methods we choose to display the users financial data. The majority of methods, such as graphs  that track spending/budgeting, that we believe could be implemented and used would be simple to add.
